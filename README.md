# Node.js and Socket.io Chat App - Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of my Node.js and Socket.io Chat App project! This repository contains the server-side code for the chat application I'm building as part of my journey in learning Node.js and Socket.io. Please be aware that this project is a work in progress, and the code may not be production-ready.

## Project Overview

The backend of this chat application is responsible for handling real-time communication between users, managing messages, and providing the necessary infrastructure for a seamless chat experience. It's a crucial part of the chat app project that's currently under development.

## Features

- Real-time chat communication through Socket.io.
- Handling user authentication and message processing.
- An ongoing project with room for improvement and expansion.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: For the server-side application.
- **Socket.io**: For enabling real-time communication.

Feel free to explore the backend code and offer any feedback or suggestions as I continue to work on this project. Your input is valuable as I strive to enhance this chat application.

Please note that both repositories are works in progress, and I appreciate your understanding as I focus on my learning journey.
